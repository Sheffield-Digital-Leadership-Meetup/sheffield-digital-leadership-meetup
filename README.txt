Sheffield Digital Leadership Meetup Jekyll Website.

Updating the site.
===

To update the site you'll need to for the `sheffield-digital-leadership-meetup` repo and create a new
branch, make your changes on that branch and create a pull request against master. When that gets merged
the Travis-CI build will kick in and publish the new wesbite in a few minutes.

Most of the site is contained in `index.html` so have a look in there for the thing
you want to change, all the elements available to you are in
https://sheffield-digital-leadership-meetup.github.io/elements.html, but really that's
just a Bootstrap demo page.

Adding a New Meetup.
===

The most common thing you'll want to do is ad a meetup, and that's really simple. Just copy one
of the files in the `_meetups` directory, filename matching the date of the meetup, and then edit
the file with the details of the new meetup.

Any questions just ask on the `leadership-meetup` channel.
